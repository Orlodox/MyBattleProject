# MyBattleProject

This project is a simulation of the battle between the two teams. It is executed in the spirit of minimalism - therefore, the units are circles.

Each unit has its own speed and distance, on which it can detect the enemy. Different commands have different parameters:
- In blue - less speed, but more coverage area locator.
- White has more speed, but less coverage area.

Thus, thanks to these differences, teams have an equal chance of winning.

When the enemy hits the unit's zone of vision, the unit makes a shot. If the enemy can not evade the bullet (the bullet has such a speed that sometimes allows to evade), then the enemy dies.

A shot is made once when one unit hits the other's scope.

Here are a few screenshots of this work:
